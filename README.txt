A friend and I made this program for out CS class.
We do some bad practices, and not the best methods. 
It was treated as more of a proof of concept. 

It uses haskell to branch of from a given link/topic on wikipedia. 
From there is generates a file that is ready to be read by an R script. 

Next the R scipt runs through and makes a graph of the found nodes and a graph of the path between 2 topics.
